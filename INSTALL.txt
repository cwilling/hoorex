A Makefile is provided for installation of the HooRex application
and manpage. Run (as root):
	make install


REQUIREMENTS.
-  the a2x utility (a Python script) is used to generate the man page
so the python and linuxdoc-tools packages will need to be installed.
-  for commandline tab completion under bash, the bash-completion package
(found in the Slackware CD's "extra" directory) must be installed. Only
terminals instantiated after installing both bash-completion and HooRex
will have tab completion enabled. Existing terminals may be enabled by
running the command:
	. /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
