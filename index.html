<p>HooRex is a dependency calculator. It uses information from the REQUIRES field of the .info file for each package available in the SlackBuilds.org (SBo) repository.
The initial motivation for creating HooRex was to know which other packages might be affected by a change to any particular package e.g. if a new version of <em>ffmpeg</em>
is built and installed, which other packages, by virtue of their dependence on <em>ffmpeg</em>, might be affected - posssibly requiring to be rebuilt themselves?
Of course it is possible to <em>find</em> all the .info files and <em>grep</em> for REQUIRES in them but the result is not clean enough, as is, for passing on to
another program or script e.g. a build bot. Also its somewhat slow to do this (there are over 5000 packages in the SBo repo), especially when dealing with multiple packages.
This (multiple packages to check) is almost always the situation after an update to the SBo repo when I want to know, programmatically, not just which of the updated packages to
rebuild but also which other packages depend on the updated packages and so may need rebuilding as well. HooRex enables this quickly and painlessly.
